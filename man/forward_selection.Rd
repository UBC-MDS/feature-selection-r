\title{Select features based on feature selection}
\usage{
forward_selection(scorer, X, y, min_features = 1, max_features = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{scorer}{A custom user-supplied function that accepts X and y
(as defined below) as input and returns the error of the datasets.}

\item{X}{data frame of training features}

\item{y}{data frame of training targets}

\item{min_features}{double. number of minimum features to select}

\item{max_features}{double. number of maximum features to select}
}
\value{
vector. The indexes of selected features
}
\description{
Select features using forward selection algorithm.
  It starts as an empty model, and add the variable with the
  highest improvement in the accuracy of the model. The process
  is iteratively repeated and it stops when the remaining variables
  doesn't improve the accuracy of the model.

\examples{
my_scorer <- function(data) {
  model <- lm(Y ~ ., data)
  return(mean(model$residuals^2))
}
data <- dplyr::select(tgp::friedman.1.data(), -Ytrue)
train_data <- data[1:(length(data)-1)]
test_data <- data[length(data)]
features <- featureselection::forward_selection(my_scorer, train_data, test_data, 3, 7)
